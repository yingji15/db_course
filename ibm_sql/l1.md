data model:

entity-relationship model

as a tool to design relationship databases

building blocks: entities and attributes

Data is organized in tables with entity relationships   

types of relationships

 building blocks of a relationship

 - entity sets

 - relationship sets

 - crows foot notation

Entities can have one-to-one or many-to-many relationships with other entities
 
 one-to-one
 
 one-to-many
 
 many-to-many

 mapping entities to tables

 ER diagram: basic foundation for design 

 ERD to Table
 
 Entities in an ERD are mapped to tables in a relational database
 
 attributes get translated into columns


relational model: based on the concept of relation

building blocks:

- relation

- sets

set: unordered + no duplicate

relational database

a set of relations

relation = math term for table

made up of 2 parts

- relational schema: name of a relation, name and type of each column

The following name and attributes indicates the Relational Schema of a table:

JOE.AUTHOR(ID integer, FIRSTNAME varchar, LASTNAME varchar)

- relational instance: a table made up of attributes or columns

column = attributes = field

row = tuple

degree = the number of attributes in a relation

cardinality = the number of tuples
